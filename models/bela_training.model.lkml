# At least three Explores. Amongst the three, there should be:
# An Explore that is cached for 4 hours (none of explores seemed like a perfect fit
# as some were etl'd daily or hourly, but I chose users as I couldn't think of a good use case
# where you'd need real time updates on users created)
# A join that uses the ‘fields’ parameter (in inventory_items, there were a lot of overlapping fields
# from distribution center and products, so I excluded products completely and only included
# distribution center name)
# # An Explore that uses the ‘always_filter’ parameter (excluded Looker's IP address from Events as you don't
# want to see your own users  web behavior)
# An Explore that uses the ‘sql_always_where’ parameter
# A join that uses the ‘view_label’ parameter
# A join that is an INNER join
# A view that is joined into the same Explore twice
#
